Atlas AI has a new customer, Kraftwerk Korp which has 500 stores located throughout Nairobi selling 3 different products: Bits, Bobs, and Widgets. 
Kraftwerk has shared with you as a data analyst their sales data which include: 
 <ul> 
  <li>Locations of each store</li>
   <li>Total sales volumes for each product</li>
  </ul>
 
Kraftwerk is trying to answer two main questions:
<ol>
  <li>What is the relationship between store performance and location, including both
socio-economic and infrastructure characteristics of location? </li>
  <li>Based on that relationship, where should Kraftwerk build more stores? </li>
</ol>
